talk_abstract: "Python has made the jump to embedded software running on microcontroller hardware.

This talk will introduce CircuitPython: a fork of MicroPython (a implementation of Python 3 designed to run on small hardware) that takes it to exciting new hardware and makes it very beginner/learner friendly."

talk_details: "Python has seen a great deal of use in the higher level application space: web, data analysis, desktop apps, etc.  Recently it's been moving in an exciting new direction: small hardware based around microcontrollers.  Where we used to be required to use C/C++ (commonly in the Arduino environment), we can now use Python.

MicroPython is a new, opensource implementation of Python3 for this type of environment, including the BBC Micro:bit.  CiruitPython is a fork of MicroPython that supports new hardware and provides a very beginner/learner friendly way to deploy code to the hardware: connect your board via USB and a drive appears, drop code onto the drive and it runs. Edit code directly on the drive. Save it and it runs. Connect to the board via a terminal emulator (e.g. screen) and you can drop into a Python REPL. A recent addition has been a compatibility layer for Raspberry Pi making CircuitPython code portable between the various microcontroller systems and the Pi.

The talk will introduce CircuitPython and various boards from Adafruit that support it as well as the Mu python programmign environment that has support for CircuitPython and associated hardware.

There will be live demos."
