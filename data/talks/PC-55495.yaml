talk_abstract: "Zero to API is a tutorial to help beginners create an authenticated API from scratch using Django, Django Rest Framework and Restauth. This is the backbone of web and mobile apps."

talk_details: |
  This is a beginner tutorial that helps users get up and running with Django and Django Rest Framework with the 
  goal of creating an authenticated API. Since API's are essential for mobile and web apps, this tutorial is a way 
  to help beginner pythonistas get their app users logged in, and use authentication on each request for their API. 
  It will lead them through creating a Django project, installing the packages required, creating the authentication 
  and then ultimately going through a basic Django project to create an authenticated API. It will also lead attendees 
  through using some useful tools for testing and debugging Restful APIs on their own.
  
  This course has been presented before at the Edmontonpy meetup to a crowd of 30-40 pythonistas, in June 2018.

  I am a proud member of the organizing committee at the Edmonton Python meetup (edmontonpy.com) and 
  I have spoken regularly and extensively in this setting. My past presentations include game development, 
  version control and various web development topics. I enjoy bringing new members into the Python community in Edmonton, 
  and watching our meetups grow month by month!
