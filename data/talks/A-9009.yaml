talk_details: |
  Have you ever seen a dog and wanted to know what breed it was? In this tutorial, you will learn how to train an image classification model using 
  transfer learning. The Azure Machine Learning SDK's PyTorch estimator enables you to easily submit PyTorch training jobs for 
  both single-node and distributed runs on Azure compute. The model is trained to classify dog breeds first using a pretrained 
  ResNet model that has been trained on the [Stanford Dog dataset](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvision.stanford.edu%2Faditya86%2FImageNetDogs%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ca-pavuon%40microsoft.com%7Cc968724834db4a5e761408d63a9b9dd8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636760837538486038&sdata=eRna7uU4aoThNdRTmQafw90pXvYop%2FPNNvQO%2BAR6ae4%3D&reserved=0).
