talk_abstract: "Symantec's data lake is filled with exabytes of data. My team uses python to trawl through it to fish for hackers, and sometimes we catch some really big fish. In this talk I will discuss various techniques to catch real criminals doing nasty things across the internet."

talk_details: "[Symantec Research Labs](https://www.symantec.com/about/corporate-profile/technology/research-labs) is the premier research team at Symantec, responsible for long-term and forward-looking projects. My work is on data analysis and correlation, where we use python to look at both historical (batch) and streaming data to detect and discover threats.

I will present two projects, both in Python, that deal with our unique collection of data. I will show how we use off-the-shelf tools and Python libraries to build sophisticated prototypes and stop very serious threats."
