talk_abstract: "When python interacts with strongly-typed systems a mapping is implicitly created.  Every.  Single.  Time.  The (1 to 0, 1 to 1, 1 to many) relationships can be unwieldy.  A related stack overflow q, Wes McKinney replies 'Welcome to Hell'. This is the story of an attempt to innovate out of hell."

talk_details: "A codification of the cognitive challenges associated with letting python talk to strongly typed systems was attempted.  This is the reasoning, approach and story of an experiment.

# Checking for Ducks [2 mins]
A brief overview of how to 'check for ducks' in python will be shared.  (subclass, isinstance, is, type, obj.property, hasattr, class.__name__, try/catch).

# Mapping Relationships Between Categories of Types [10 mins]
A hypothesis will be stated that all object types can be binned into one of four bins (Builtin, Library-Supplied, Developer/User-Created, External).  We define 'External', as a means to explain non-python representations of objects in some other system (eg. JSON, a Database).  A few cherry-picked examples will be shared of the more complex relationships where python has a builtin type, that do not map 1:1 to external types, and highlighted with how libraries have attempted to fill in the gap.  (Eg. Dates & Time)  I'll show how messy this can get over time as technical debt adds up.  I'll posit a phenomenon named 'The Mandatory Type Mapping Principle' to explain what I mean by the fact that type mappings happen 'Every. Single. Time.'

# Mapping Maintaining Rule Engine [10 mins]
The API and object model for a proprietary rule engine is shared.  The maintainability has proven the API to be extremely robust.  It's also defendably beautiful, explicit, flat, readable, and finished (ie PEP 20 compliant).

# Context in Pensions [5 mins]
Experiences will be shared in the context of a developer's workflow from the perspective of a developer, and a manager of developers, at one of Canada's largest asset managers.

# Questions [3 mins]
You know...if I don't run out of time."
