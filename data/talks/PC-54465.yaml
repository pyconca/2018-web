talk_abstract: "When python interacts with strongly-typed systems a mapping is implicitly created.  Every.  Single.  Time.  The (1 to 0, 1 to 1, 1 to many) relationships can be unwieldy.  A related stack overflow question, Wes McKinney replies 'Welcome to Hell'. This is the story of an attempt to innovate out of hell."

talk_details: "A codification of the cognitive challenges associated with letting python talk to strongly typed systems was attempted.  This is the reasoning, approach and story of an experiment."
