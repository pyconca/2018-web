  Learn the ABCs of Kubernetes and how to get started on using  managed
  containers for your python development on your local machine and also for
  production deployments on a cloud provider-managed Kubernetes cluster.

talk_details: |
  Kubernetes is transforming deployment and operations workflows from server/VM
  based full-stack deployments to container-based application deployments. The
  container approach drives consistency across development, test and production
  environments (artifact immutability) and increases efficiency due to lower OS
  stack overheads of running containers.

  In this tutorial we will learn how to get started with Kubernetes, a container
  orchestration engine that brings benefits like automated rollouts and
  rollbacks, active service health montioring, automatic scaling and
  infrastructure-as-code SCM benefits to deployment tasks. Starting from a brief
  overview of Docker (the most popular container runtime) we will go over how to
  install and start Kubernetes using a local (laptop) installation method called
  Minikube. We will get familiar with the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) and then
  create our first django deployment on our local Kubernetes cluster. Then we'll
  go over some architectural choices when using Kubernetes in a production
  setting - for example choosing storage, databases and other stateful
  components. Finally we will deploy our django application on a cloud-based
  Kubernetes cluster and try out some of the nifty Kubernetes features such as
  scaling and automated rollouts and rollbacks. We will end the tutorial with a
  list of resources and next-steps you can take to get up to speed
  with Kubernetes.
