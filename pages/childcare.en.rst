We have on-site childcare available for the main conference days on November 10 and 11th for attendees. 

`Improv Care <http://www.improvcare.ca>`_ will be providing the service for us this year and they've asked that all parents fill in a form for each child.

Many thanks to `Freshbooks <https://freshbooks.com>`_ for sponsoring this year's childcare. 

The form is available here:
